#The retail dataset we have consists of sales information from an online store operating nationwide, selling products across various departments. Additionally, the store operates through multiple sales channels, including marketplaces and its own storefront.

Business Premises: When analyzing the data, it's important to consider the following business assumptions. First, due to a system error, some purchases lack state information. To address this, it has been decided to assign these purchases to Mato Grosso do Sul (MS). Second, the final price of a product cannot exceed the price including shipping.

Metrics: Based on this context and the established business assumptions, we can evaluate the following metrics:

Best-selling Departments: By analyzing the sales data, we can identify the most popular departments among customers. This information can help us understand which products are in highest demand and adjust the store's sales strategy accordingly.
Average Price with Shipping by Department: To understand pricing behavior by department, we can calculate the average price including shipping per department. This metric can help identify the most profitable departments and adjust product pricing according to the desired profit margin.
Monthly Sales Volume: By analyzing the number of sales made each month, we can identify seasonal trends in customer purchasing behavior and plan specific marketing campaigns for each period.
Average Customer Income by Sales Channel: Identifying the average customer income across different sales channels can help the store tailor its marketing and sales strategy for each target audience.
Average Customer Age by Brand: Knowing the age range of customers by brand can help identify consumer profiles and adjust the sales strategy to better serve each audience.
